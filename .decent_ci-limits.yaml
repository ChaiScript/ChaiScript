# configurable limits for your repository build history

# this file is loaded from the trusted branch for your repository, which
# can be configured on the command line to ci.rb
# or defaults to the "default branch" configured by github

# Note that there is a failsafe limit that comes in
# if any individual folder is approaching 1000 files
# to take care of limits imposed by github

# Note that these values represent the defaults

# After this number is hit the subsequent limits come into play
history_total_file_limit: 1240

# which attempt to maintain a longer history
